!!! warning "Performance tip"
    If you’re processing large vectors or doing millions of transforms, you can get **up to 30 %** more speed by compiling and linking your own optimized FFHT library.
    See the [Custom FHT Library](CustomFHT.html) guide for how to build, enable and revert your own `.so`.
